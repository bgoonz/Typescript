# Typescript
- [Typescript Docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html)

**Typescript** is a superset of Javascript that adds static typing to the language. It is a great way to add type safety to your Javascript code. 

- Unfortunately browsers & node.js cannot exicute typescript directly.
- Typescript must be compiled to Javascript before it can be run.
